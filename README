Introduction
Media Brute's purpose is to automatically collect, compile, minify, and cache all JS and CSS for a Django project. It then has context processors that allow that minified JS and CSS to be referenced in the templates.

It will crawl through a "main" js and css directory (2 different directories) which sits in the settings.MEDIA_ROOT. It will then crawl through all settings.INSTALLED_APPS looking for CSS and JS as well. Once it finds everything, it will compile everything that it has found, minify it, and cache it.

collect -> compile -> minify -> write to cache

It does timestamp checking, so it only updates the cache'd file when it finds a css or js file that has been modified since the cache'd file was created. (It does this for CSS and JS separately).

It is great for projects where only 1 js and/or css file needs to be cached for the entire site/project.

important Configurations
At the very least, these two settings should be added to your django settings file.
CSS_DIR
	- Main CSS directory inside MEDIA_ROOT, 
	- Defaults to "css"
JS_DIR 
	-  Main JS directory inside MEDIA_ROOT
	- Defaults to "js"


Additional Configurations
	APP_CSS : where app-specific CSS will sit in app directory
		e.g. : "media/css", 
		defaults to "css"

	APP_JS : where app-specific JS will sit in app directory
		e.g. : "media/js", 
		defaults to "css"

	CSS_TOP_FILES : the list of files that should go at the top of the final CSS file
		i.e. : things that should be overrideable
		e.g. css resets, other standard sheets
	
	CSS_BOTTOM_FILES : the list of filenames that should go at the bottom of the final CSS file
		i.e. : things that should have "the final say"
		e.g. files with lots of media queries for responsive design
